        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p> Pumpkin pie is a custard-based pie with a sweet filling typically
            made of pumpkin purée mixed with eggs, evaporated milk, and warm
            spices such as cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. Pumpkin pie is
            typically an open-face, single crust pie baked in a pastry crust or
            a graham cracker crust, or you can make a crustless pumpkin pie, if
            you prefer.</p>
        <p>
            Here, we'll show you how to make from-scratch pumpkin pie based on
            this top-rated Homemade Fresh Pumpkin Pie recipe from recipe creator
            Nancy Scott. <strong>Note:</strong> If your pumpkin is large enough,
            you may double this recipe to make two pies.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Pastry for the Single-Crust Pie: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup shortening</li>
            <li>3 ½ tablespoons cold water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Filling: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>2 cups mashed, cooked pumpkin, or about 1 1/2 pounds skin-on,
                    raw pumpkin;<strong> Shortcut:</strong> You can substitute
                    with canned pumpkin. Before you buy, you should check the
                    label to make sure of what's in the can; if it's labeled
                    "pumpkin pie filling" it's already spiced. If you plan to
                    sweeten yourself with the ingredients below, go for
                    unflavored canned pumpkin. </p></li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>¾ cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3><strong>Prepare Mashed Pumpkin</strong></h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Halve pumpkin and scoop out seeds and stringy portions.
                        You can save the seeds for a roasted, crunchy snack.</li>
                    <li>2. Cut the pumpkin into chunks.</li>
                    <li>3. In a saucepan over medium heat, cover the pumpkin chunks
                        with 1 inch of water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to
                        low, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes or until tender.</li>
                    <li>4. Drain, cool and remove the peel. Return pumpkin to the
                        saucepan and mash with a potato masher or use a food
                        mill.
                    </li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Preheat oven</strong></li>
                <ul>
                <li>1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</li>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Prepare Pie Crust</strong></li>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Prepare pie crust by mixing together the flour, sugar,
                        and salt.</li>
                    <li>2. Cut shortening into flour; add cold water 1 tablespoon
                        at a time (you may need only 3 tablespoons, or up to 4
                        tablespoons).</li>
                    <li>3. Mix dough and repeat until dough is moist enough to hold
                        together.</li>
                    <li>4. Shape the dough into a flat disc, wrap in plastic wrap,
                        and let chill in the refrigerator for at least 30
                        minutes.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Form Pie Crust</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. With lightly floured, hands shape dough into a ball.
                        On a lightly floured board, roll dough out to about 1/8
                        inch thickness.
                    </li>
                    <li>2. With a sharp knife, cut dough 1 1/2 inch larger than
                        the upside-down 8- to 9-inch pie pan. (You can use any
                        dough scraps to make decorative shapes using small
                        leaf-shaped cookie cutters and place them on top of the
                        pie filling.)</li>
                    <li>3. Gently roll the dough around the rolling pin and
                        transfer it right-side up onto the pie pan. Unroll,
                        easing dough into the bottom of the pie pan. Form a
                        crust by folding the overhanging edges under and crimp
                        as desired.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Make Pie Filling</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. In a large bowl, beat pumpkin with evaporated milk,
                        eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt
                        with an electric mixer or immersion blender. Mix well.</li>
                    <li>2. Pour the filling into your prepared crust.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Bake Pie</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bake 40 minutes or until when a knife is inserted 1 inch from
                the edge comes out clean.</li>
                </ul>
